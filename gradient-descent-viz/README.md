# Gradient Descent for Neural Networks with some visualization.
* This notebook was created during my Deep Learning Nanodegree course (UDACITY).
* First the data is processed into a datframe from a csv.
* Then the functions for the neural network are created.
* After this the neural network is trained using gradient descent.
* Finally some graphs are plotted to visualize the results.
